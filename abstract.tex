A strong femto-second laser pulse ($800nm$, $10^{15} W/cm^2$, $100fs$ pulse width) was directed to Helium gas (atom density:$10^{18}cm^{-3}$). The atoms are fully ionized in this optical field (E: $10^8 V/m$), and plasma is created. Due to collisons, ionized electrons repopulate all the energy levels of Helium in nanoseond time scale. Then with beams from OPA directed to the gas, whose wavelengh matches the energy difference of levels intersted, the coherence in the atoms are created. With the presence of coherence,the lasing without inversion scheme is created. Finally a transint lasing gain without population inversion between $2^1P$ and $2^1S$ was expected, whose wavelength is $58nm$.

We study possibility of lasing without population inversion in
transient regime in $\Lambda$-scheme with a coherent drive which can
be used for makeing a laser operating in XUV or X-ray bands based on
excited Helium atoms.
