* Introduction
** X-Ray Laser
To make an X-ray laser at 58nm.
ionization-recombination

The ion-electron recombination occurs on a time scale faster then 1 ps
which creates $Li^{2+}$ (He-like) ions in highly excited states (large principle quantum number n). By collisions atoms are transferred to states with smaller n on a few ps time scale. For proper density population inversion between the level n = 2 and the ground state (n = 1) is created for 10 − 100 ps. This results in lasing on the wavelength of the n = 2 to n = 1 transition (13.5nm) which is measured by a spectrometer.

*** Principle
Usually, the gain medium of a laser works on the basis of a population inversion. In the 1990s, however, it was shown that optical amplification and consequently lasing without inversion are possible by using an additional optical or microwave field which induces a quantum coherence in the atoms of the gain medium. The basic idea is to provide two different pathways for atoms to get from the ground state to the excited state – a direct one and another one via a third energy level –, and to induce a quantum coherence, so that the quantum-mechanical probability amplitudes for both processes cancel. In effect, this suppresses the reabsorption and thus makes it possible to obtain gain even with a small population in the upper state.

In principle, lasing without inversion could help, e.g., in realizing lasers operating on very short wavelengths, where a population inversion is difficult to achieve.
*** Dark State
The idea:
Pump atoms into dark state, then emission from |1> can exceed absorption from ground states.

*** Atomic Coherence 						   :Question:
In physics, atomic coherence is the induced coherence between levels of a multi-level atomic  system sometimes observed when it interacts with a coherent electromagnetic field.

*** Rabi frequency						   :Question:
The Rabi frequency for a given atomic transition in a given light field gives the strength of the coupling between the light and the transition. Rabi flopping between the levels of a 2-level system illuminated with resonant light, will occur at the Rabi frequency. The Rabi frequency is a semiclassical  concept as it is based on a quantum atomic transition and a classical light field.

*** Helium
The brightness of an Atomic spectral line emitted by atoms in a gas (or plasma) can be proportional to the gas's temperature, pressure or a weighted sum of both.

*** Power density
*** Inversion or No inversion

**** Powers
**** Lens
a low power 2 Hz Nd/YAG laser (100 mJ, 5ns) was focused with an f/6 lens.

After a few hundred nsec delay (varied between 300 and 1000 ns), the Ti:sapphire 250 fs
laser was fired, whose energy is 50 − 60 mJ in a repetition rate 2 Hz. This femto-second
laser was tightly focused with the same f/6 lens onto the plasma at the entrance of the
microcapillary providing a power density close to 2×1017 W/cm2.

was directed to the microcapillary by a near 100reflectivity mirror, M1, and the femto-second
laser beam was directed by directed by a mirror, M2 which is transparent for the 1.06 μm
wavelength of the Nd/YAG laser. From the output spectra, we could see the soft X-ray
lasing.
